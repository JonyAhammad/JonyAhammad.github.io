On this website I will tell you about stuff I like

### Coding
Line by line, I build ideas into reality — every bug fixed is a small victory.

### Cybersecurity
Guarding systems, cracking codes, and staying one step ahead — security is my digital armor.

### Web Design
Turning creativity into structure — I love blending beauty with functionality on the web.

### My Projects
Each project teaches me something new — from building apps to creating interactive websites.

### Music
Where logic meets emotion — beats and melodies keep me focused and inspired.

### Gaming
Strategy, reflex, and fun — a digital playground to sharpen focus and chill at the same time.

### Learning
Technology never stops evolving, and neither do I. I love exploring new tools, languages, and skills.

### Fitness
A healthy body fuels a focused mind — workouts keep my creativity and code strong.

### Travel
New places, new perspectives — every trip inspires new ideas.

### Work
Where I turn coffee into code and challenges into opportunities.
