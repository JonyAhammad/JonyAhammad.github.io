### Lesson 5: Blockquotes

**Exercise 1: Blockquote the phrase "I read this great book today."**
> I read this great book today. Information Technology (IT) has transformed the way people live, work, and communicate. One positive impact of IT is the improvement of education and access to information. Students can now use online learning platforms, digital libraries, and educational apps to study anytime and anywhere. For example, in my home country, Bangladesh, many schools adopted online classes during the COVID-19 pandemic using Zoom and Google Classroom. This allowed students to continue their studies even when schools were closed. IT has therefore made education more flexible and accessible to everyone.

**Exercise 2: Blockquote the text and include a nested quote from Moby Dick..**
> I said, "That's a great blockquote."
>
> > "Call me Ishmael."
> > However, IT also has negative effects on society. One major issue is the spread of misinformation through social media. False news and rumors can quickly go viral, causing confusion and even panic. In Bangladesh, for instance, there have been cases where fake news on Facebook led to public unrest and misunderstandings. Additionally, spending too much time online can affect people’s mental health and reduce real-life social interaction


**Exercise 3: Blockquote the entire quote, including the line break.**
> We're all here`
`>`
`> now.

### Lesson 7: Paragraphs and Line Breaks

**Exercise 1: Create a single paragraph from the following  sentences.**
This is the first sentence, which begins the paragraph by introducing a simple statement. The second sentence continues the thought, providing a smooth transition and maintaining the flow of the idea. Finally, the third sentence concludes the paragraph, tying everything together into one coherent and complete piece of writing.

**Exercise 2: Create two separate paragraphs, with the first two sentences in the first paragraph, and the third sentence in the second paragraph.**
This is the first sentence. This is the second sentence.

This is the third sentence.This is the first sentence, which begins the paragraph and introduces the reader to the main idea in a clear and simple way. The second sentence continues the thought, adding more information and helping the paragraph flow naturally from one idea to the next. Finally, the third sentence brings the paragraph to a smooth and logical conclusion, summarizing the key point and giving a sense of completeness. Together, these three sentences form a well-structured paragraph that demonstrates how short, clear statements can be combined to create organized and meaningful writing.
